currentcostd is a python based daemon designed to listen to the output from the currentcost devices, and then store the corresponding data in an RRD database.

The daemon can currently:
  * Switch user
  * Run the foreground for debugging purposes
  * Runs an optional, basic, HTTP server where you can see the current power and temperature

ToDos:
  * Make the HTTP server a bit better so that it can serve some static files and introduce a bit of templating
  * More error checking
  * Periodical generation of graphs so that they can be included in the web page(s)

Issues:
  * It doesn't understand multiple sensors
  * Error checking is barely there
  * The code is probably pretty poor. My excuse is that python makes me angry and this was an attempt to see if I could live with it.

At present it depends on:
  * pyserial
  * python-rrdtool
