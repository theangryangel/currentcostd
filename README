currentcostd is a python based daemon designed to listen to the output from the currentcost devices, and then store the corresponding data in an RRD database.

The daemon can currently:
  * Switch user
  * Run the foreground for debugging purposes
  * Runs an optional, basic, HTTP server where you can see the current power and temperature, and serve static files (Note, static files are very badly done and is probably exploitable at this point - just needed something working here for a demo)

ToDos:
  * Make the HTTP server less crap
  * More error checking
  * Periodical generation of graphs so that they can be included in the web page(s)

Issues:
  * It doesn't understand multiple sensors
  * Error checking is barely there
  * The code is probably pretty poor. My excuse is that python makes me angry and this was an attempt to see if I could live with it.

At present it depends on:
  * pyserial
  * python-rrdtool
